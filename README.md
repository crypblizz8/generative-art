# Generative Art

Generative Art / Creative Coding heavily inspires me to see computing and art coming together in the 20-21st century. Randomness is a sort of expression that can create beauty.

### Randomness
I see nature as randomness (leaves, snowflakes, tree growth etc.).
Human interactions can also be random and turn into beautiful relationships.

Using this repo as a place for me to document my learning / my work. 
<br/>
Goal is to keep creating, learning and making as much GA.

### Cirriculum
0. Fundamentals. Understand majority of the structure + syntax.
1. At first [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain)
2. Emulating artist works that I like
3. [Google Sheet I am creating to document all my Tutorials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IIMy_eI_Y_LFiQ1tczErNBZhhd7b5KmkrxwrjYolFYQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### Inspiration

- Fashion
- GA Artists (Tyler Hobbs, Tim Rodenberg, Zach Lieberman)
- GA Platforms (ArtBlocks, FxHash)

### Examples of what can be created
- [Code Studio (p5)](https://codestudio-p5.netlify.app/)

### Inspiration
1. Zondrian (Mondrian drawings in p5.js) + web3 integration attempt
2. Perlin Noise (Understand the algo with respect to noise, noiseDetail and randomness)

### To Do
- Each sketch file in a sub folder gets rendered onto a deployed site.
