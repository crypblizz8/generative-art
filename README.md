# Generative Art

Generative Art heavily inspires me to see computing and art coming together in the 20-21st century. Randomness is a sort of expression that can create beauty. 

### Randomness
I see nature as randomness (leaves, snowflakes, tree growth etc.).
Human interactions can also be random and turn into beautiful relationships.

Using this repo as a place for me to document my learning / my work.

Goal is to keep creating, learning and making as much GA.
